Scripion is a versatile tool designed to streamline command management on your device. For developers and engineers who often find themselves navigating the intricacies of the shell and terminal, Scripion is a trusted companion. While these command-line interfaces are invaluable for complex tasks, not all commands require their full attention.

With Scripion, you can effortlessly organize and execute a wide range of commands without the need for constant terminal interaction. This user-friendly application simplifies the process of handling basic scripts, allowing you to focus your valuable terminal resources on more critical tasks.

# Installation
MacOS: [Scrripion Beta v0.0.1](https://github.com/nomadiz/scripion/releases/download/beta-v0.0.1/Scripion_beta_0.0.1_aarch64.dmg)

# Features
## Store commands in your workspace

Scripion allows you to store, update workspace names, and remove workspaces easily. Regarding privacy concerns, workspaces are stored locally on your device using SQLite3. 
### Integrate with different framework projects
Support: `package.json` projects
Scripion automatically reads package.json from the imported workspaces and stores them as Scripion's workspace scripts with interactive UI. To import the workspace, click on the **+ Add workspace** button. If the workspace is not a valid project, it won't be imported to Scripion.
## Execute command with one click

Scripion streamlines script history management by offering a unified view of scripts executed across various shells. This feature simplifies record-keeping, ensuring that you can efficiently trace your scripting activities.
